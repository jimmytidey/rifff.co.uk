				<p>Making music physical</p>
				
				<p>Music has always been affected by technology: Beethoven's composition was influenced by the increasingly large pianos that were available to him, the 3 minute pop song is a consequence of the playback time of 78rpm vinyl.   

				<p>Nearly everyone listens to music on a device with a powerful computer in it - whether it's a laptop or an iPod nano, but the only thing we use it for is o compress music into the MP3 format.</p>
